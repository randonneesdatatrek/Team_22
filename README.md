# LesCousinesPartentEnRan.DonÃ©e

Hello!

We are Aira Serrame and Jamie Barcena. We are cousins and we grew up together. 
Aira studies Biomedical Science at Ryerson University, while Jamie studied Marketing at Seneca College.

We signed up for Data.Trek because we wanted to learn something new and cool this year!

## A little bit about us:

ğŸ”­ We are currently working on the dataset [DonnÃ©es QUALO annuelles](https://www.donneesquebec.ca/recherche/dataset/vmtl-rsma-qualite-de-l-eau-en-rive-qualo) (donnÃ©es du programme QUALO, qualitÃ© de lâ€™eau en rive du RÃ©seau de suivi du milieu aquatique). 
  * We are building a prediction model of water quality using data from the past 13 years to identify which rivers surrounding Montreal are suitable for summer activities such as kayaking, paddling, etc.
  * We are testing for the amount of fecal coliform (colonies/100mL) in each riverbank. The more fecal coliform there is in the water, the greater the risk for contracting the diseases, and the less suitable it is to conduct water activities.
