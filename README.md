# LesCousinesPartentEnRan.Donée

Hello!

We are Aira Serrame and Jamie Barcena. We are cousins and we grew up together. 
Aira studies Biomedical Science at Ryerson University, while Jamie studied Marketing at Seneca College.

We signed up for Data.Trek because we wanted to learn something new and cool this year!

## A little bit about us:

🔭 We are currently working on a [Breast Cancer Data Set from Wisconsin](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29). The data set is quite old, it's from November 1995. We still want to model the data set because we would like to see how the past (and old) data analyses compare to our data analysis in the present. Using the latest version of Python, we would like to see how accurate their data analyses were in the past.
